For the reason of limited size for uploading data on github repo, we did not have all datasets here.           

To run the ipython notebook where we show example of digits, you should download the 'digits' dataset from https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/2321#participate and put it to 'entire_data/Round_0/digits'.

Same for other datasets, the path should be 'entire_data/Round_?/dataset_name'
